2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: 
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500:   HNP daemon   : [[55744,0],0] on node hnod2-10-49
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500:   Remote daemon: [[55744,0],3] on node hnod2-11-2
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: 
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
2021-04-21T17:05:27-0500: therefore will terminate the job.

2021-04-21T17:05:59-0500: An ORTE daemon has unexpectedly failed after launch and before
2021-04-21T17:05:59-0500: communicating back to mpirun. This could be caused by a number
2021-04-21T17:05:59-0500: of factors, including an inability to create a connection back
2021-04-21T17:05:59-0500: to mpirun due to a lack of common network interfaces and/or no
2021-04-21T17:05:59-0500: route found between them. Please check network connectivity
2021-04-21T17:05:59-0500: (including firewalls and network routing requirements).
